Natural language pro##cessing is an interdisciplinary subfield o##f linguistics, co##mputer science, and artificial intelligence co##ncerned with the interactio##ns between co##mputers and human language, in particular ho##w to## pro##gram co##mputers to## pro##cess and analyze large amo##unts o##f natural language data. The go##al is a co##mputer capable o##f "understanding" the co##ntents o##f do##cuments, including the co##ntextual nuances o##f the language within them. The techno##lo##gy can then accurately extract info##rmatio##n and insights co##ntained in the do##cuments as well as catego##rize and o##rganize the do##cuments themselves. Challenges in natural language pro##cessing frequently invo##lve speech reco##gnitio##n, natural language understanding, and natural language generatio##n. Natural language pro##cessing has its ro##o##ts in the 1950s. Already in 1950, Alan Turing published an article titled "Co##mputing Machinery and Intelligence" which pro##po##sed what is no##w called the Turing test as a criterio##n o##f intelligence, tho##ugh at the time that was no##t articulated as a pro##blem separate fro##m artificial intelligence.
